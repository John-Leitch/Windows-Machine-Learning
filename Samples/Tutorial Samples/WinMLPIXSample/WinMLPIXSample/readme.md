    C++/WinRT WinMLPIXSample Project Overview
===========================================================================

This project demonstrates how to get started using PIX for windows to do
GPU captures as well as setting markers programmatically.

When run, the program will do a capture and save the generated .wpix file
under folder PIXCapture.

NOTE: This sample uses redist build of PIX and loads WinPixEventRuntime.dll
dynamically
